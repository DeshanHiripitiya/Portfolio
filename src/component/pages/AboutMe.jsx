          With a passion for discovery and collaboration, I approach every
          project with dedication. My background at the University of Moratuwaâ€™s
          Faculty of Information Technology has equipped me with a diverse skill
          set, including both frontend and backend technologies. Whether
          tackling complex challenges or exploring new opportunities, I am
          committed to continuous learning and growth.
          <br />
          <br />I also enjoy sharing my knowledge to help others develop their
          skills. My goal is to contribute effectively to dynamic teams and make
          meaningful strides in my field, turning every project into an
          innovation and success.
